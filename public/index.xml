                    <description>We have some fantastic news to share: two CCS.Amsterdam researchers were granted prestigious NWO VENI research grants! Congratulations to Andreu Casas and Philipp Masur! See brief project summaries below. Free Speech and Censorship in the Digital Society: A computational study of the determinants and effects of political speech regulation by social media companies Andreu Casas, VU Amsterdam
Private social media companies increasingly play a role in regulating (political) speech online, posing a clear threat to democratic accountability.</description>

                    <description>In her VENI, Mariken van der Velden theorizes that political compromises force politicians to strategically communicate their decisions in order to mitigate electoral costs. Comparing the Dutch, German and Spanish case, she test her argument at three levels: the politicians level, employing advanced computational text approaches coupled with case-oriented approaches to identify how politicians make compromises and when they adapt their rhetoric to justify them; on the voter level, experimentally investigating the willingness to accept compromises using Virtual Reality techniques; and bridging the two by utilizing regression and experimental techniques to study the real-world effects of compromises.</description>
