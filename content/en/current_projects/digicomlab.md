The Digital Communication Methods Lab aims to support innovative work on methods, analyses, and scientific practices relevant to communication science. We organise regular lab meetings to discuss and share knowledge about cutting edge methods in communication research. In addition to lab meetings, we also serve as a hub for methodological consultation and collaboration. We also have a list of equipments to support data collection, including an eye tracker, VR glasses, and a telepresence robot. If you would like to borrow equipments or connect with our methods experts, please send a request using our [in-take form](https://bit.ly/uvadigicomlab).
