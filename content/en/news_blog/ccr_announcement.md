<p>We are very excited to announce that we just launched Computational Communication Research (CCR), a new open-access peer-reviewed journal dedicated to development and applications of computational methods for communication science. We hope that CCR will serve as central home for communication scientists with an interest in and focus on computational methods — a place to read and publish the cutting edge work in our growing subfield.</p>

<p>Please see the inaugural call for papers at&nbsp;<a href="http://computationalcommunication.org/inaugural-cfp/">http://computationalcommunication.org/inaugural-cfp/</a>&nbsp;(abstracts 30 Sept, manuscripts 30 Nov), and consider submitting your best computational work to the first issue!</p>

<p>Don’t hesitate to contact us for more information, and looking forward to your submissions!</p>
