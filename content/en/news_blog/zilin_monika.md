<p>We are happy to announce that two great PhD students join CCS.amsterdam in February: Zilin Lin and Mónika Simon!</p>

<p>Zilin and Mónika will be working on the ERC Starting Grant funded project <a href="http://ccs.amsterdam/projects/newsflows/">NEWSFLOWS Modeling News Flows: How Feedback Loops Influence Citizens' Beliefs and Shape Societies</a>. They will be using online field experiments, data donations and automated content analysis to study how information spreads in today's media ecosystem. Zilin will be supervised by Damian Trilling, Susan Vermeer and Kasper Welbers, and Mónika's supervision team consists of Damian Trilling, Anne Kroon and Kasper Welbers. Both Zilin and Mónika are recent graduates from the research master in Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam. </p>

<p>We are very happy Amsterdam got to keep them, and we are looking forward to working with you on these topics!</p>
