<p>On 9 and 10 October, a UvA-VU team consisting of Myrthe Reuver, Felicia Loecherbach, Nicolas Mattis, Sanne Vrijenhoek, and Marijn Sax took part in a 24-hour hackathon organized by the Dutch Public Broadcaster NPO. The teams were ask to help build solutions to promote diverse content to NPOstart users. The Geeky Griffins (as the team was called) built a new explore feature, as well as a match me up feature which — in line with a longstanding Dutch tradition — allows users to sneak a peek into the digital living room of other people through their open curtains. After deliberations by an expert jury, The Geeky Griffins were declared the winners of the hackathon.</p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>
