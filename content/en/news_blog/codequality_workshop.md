<p>The first part of the workshop on code quality organised by Wouter van Atteveldt and Urja Khurana took place yesterday. As expected during these times, it was taught in hybrid fashion: online and in-person at the VU University Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Code should be readable and reusable, but the how-to's are not often taught in a computational social science curriculum. Wouter and Urja filled in the gaps by covering the what and why, structure, documentation, typing and testing! The workshop participants were also challenged to improve some (intentionally badly written) Python code. </p>

<p>The follow-up workshop will take place on March 17, 2022.</p>
