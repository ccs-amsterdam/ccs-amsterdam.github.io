<p>The CCS.Amsterdam mini workshops kicked off with a workshop on Git(hub)! Many thanks to Kasper, Wouter and Sanne for organising this!</p>

<p>We covered the basic stuff (what is Git, what is Github, init, clone, add, commit, push, pull) and the more advanced features (branches, forks, pull requests), tricky problems (oops I committed my API key) and convenient tools for writing better code (Codacy, Travis, Dependabot). </p>

<p>Couldn't attend this workshop but also interested in learning more about Git? Check out the materials for this workshop on <a href="https://github.com/vanatteveldt/github-workshop" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more mini workshops! </p>
