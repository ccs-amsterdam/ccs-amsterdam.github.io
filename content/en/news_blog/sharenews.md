<p>We got a new project – <a href="http://ccs.amsterdam/projects/sharenews-predicting-the-shareworthiness-of-real-and-fake-news-in-europe/">SHARENEWS</a>! We are happy to announce that we got funding (and data access) to conduct a multi-national project on the shareworthiness of news on Facebook. The multi-national project is coordinated by a PI from ccs.amsterdam, Damian Trilling; and also Judith Möller, Wouter van Atteveldt, and Claes de Vreese are part of the Amsterdam team. See <a href="https://www.ssrc.org/fellowships/view/social-media-and-democracy-research-grants/grantees/trilling/">here</a> for the whole team.</p>
