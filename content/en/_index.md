##### Welcome to the Computational Communication Science Amsterdam (CCS Amsterdam) website. On our website you can find an overview of news, ongoing and concluded research projects, publications, and resources for teaching and learning computational methods for social/communication science.

### What is CCS Amsterdam?

CCS Amsterdam is a group of computational communication scientists from the University of Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Across various research projects, we aim at employing and developing computational methods in order to answer social scientific research questions. This includes, among other exciting topics, research into news flows, polarisation, political microtargeting, fake news and recommender design.

A core goal of our group is to disseminate knowledge among a growing community of enthusiastic computational communication scientists. To this end, we are organising regular mini-workshops, research talks and guest lectures that are attended by the core CCS.Amsterdam group, as well as interested members and students from the VU’s and UvA’s communication science departments.
